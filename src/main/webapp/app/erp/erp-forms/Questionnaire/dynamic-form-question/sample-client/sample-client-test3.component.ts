/**
 * This is the famous dynamic forms tutorial from the site https://angular.io/guide/dynamic-form
 * We make very very minor amendments to fetch the same data from a json file to mock actual constrains
 * of real http calls, and the challenge of designing google's model into a secured and editable
 * information from an API. Thereupon it will be possible to create form objects on the fly, enabling
 * spontaneous definition of reports and forms used to parameterize such reports
